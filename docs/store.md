# Rising Ranges

A relative, 3D-aware range and altitude measuring tool. Drag from an Origin — a
point or a token — and see live range rings, a Reading on every other token,
and optional persistent height markers.

## Features

- **Relative range measuring** — click and drag from any point or token to
  reveal concentric range bands (Melee, Very Close, Close, Far, Very Far — or
  your own).
- **Height / altitude tracking** — right-click a token to set a persistent
  height marker, or nudge height live with hotkeys while measuring, range by
  range or one grid cell at a time. Readings account for height in 3D, with a
  choice of spherical, cubic, or cylindrical distance, and big creatures take
  up height too.
- **Three built-in presets** — Dagger, Steel (Draw Steel's distances,
  measured square by square), and Dragons — or build your own set of ranges
  from scratch.
- **Multiple visualization styles** — icon stacks, rings, or filled circles,
  independently sized and colored.
- **Color-blind friendly themes** — Base, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, and
  Protanopia.
- **Bilingual** — Español / English, switchable per room.
- **Configurable hotkeys and feature toggles** — strip it back to plain
  range-rings with no per-token readings or height tracking at all, if that's
  all you need.

## How to use

1. Select the Rising Ranges tool from the toolbar and drag from a token
   or an empty point to set your Origin.
2. Every other token gets a live Reading showing which range band it's in,
   with an arrow if it's above or below you.
3. While measuring, use the configurable hotkeys to raise or lower the
   Origin's height, or put it back on the ground.
4. Right-click any token to set a persistent height marker that sticks around
   outside of a measurement.

## Build your own ranges

Start from Dagger, Steel, or Dragons — duplicate one to edit it — or build
your own: name each range, set its radius and icon, and choose how distance
is calculated (spherical / cubic / cylindrical), whether heights step by range
or by grid cell, and how forgiving Tolerance is. An optional Final Range
names everything past the farthest one.

## What shows on the map

How each measured token is marked (an icon, a ring, a circle, or nothing),
what its label says (the Range, the exact distance, or both), and what the
rings around the Origin say — with any set of ranges, presets included.

## Distances panel

Pick a token to list every other one with its Range and its horizontal,
vertical and total distance, live as tokens move — for the GM only or for
everyone; players never see hidden tokens. Drag it anywhere on screen by its
handle.

## Settings

Set the room's language and hotkeys, and toggle whole feature groups on or
off — including stripping the extension back to plain range-rings with no
readings or height tracking. Every setting applies right away.

## About this fork

This project is a modified version of [Ranges](https://github.com/owlbear-rodeo/ranges)
by Owlbear Rodeo, licensed under the GNU GPLv3. It merges Ranges' range-ring
rendering with a relative altitude/height mechanic and a configurable 3D
distance engine.
